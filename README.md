Inspiration: 
EcoPick is a chrome extension designed to make online shopping smarter and more sustainable. When users browse their cart on a shopping site, it automatically scans the listed products and uses AI to analyze each item’s affordability and environmental impact. The extension then highlights which items offer the best balance between price and sustainability, all without requiring the user to leave the page. In just one click, shoppers can identify the most wallet-friendly and eco-friendly options from their wishlist, helping them make better purchasing decisions instantly.
